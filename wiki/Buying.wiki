#summary Where to buy M5451 and other hardware

== MM5451YN ==
The M5451 chip is available either as a 40 pin DIP package (breadboardable) or as a surface mount package.  The part is no longer produced by ST Microelectronics in DIP format so that confuses the issue, but Micrel has it under the MM5451YN name.  I sourced mine from Future Electronics:

Future electronic also carries surface mount versions

You can buy ST Microelectronics surface mount parts from Mouser:

I had 10 prototypes built which are a few more than I need so drop me an email or add a comment here (with your obfuscated email address) if you would like one.  Unfortunately, due to the low volume production, it cost me about $10 a board for the circuit boards.  Each Micrel part is $3.67, so when you add in the IDE connectors and so forth, I'm breaking even at about $19.99 not even counting the labor of soldering it all together.  It would be cheaper if there is enough interest to do higher volume.
